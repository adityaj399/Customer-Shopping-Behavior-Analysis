This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across various product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic business decisions.
Deliverables 
1. Data Preparation & Modeling (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for 
analysis. 
2. Data Analysis (SQL): Organize the data into a structured format, simulate business 
transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and 
purchase drivers. 
3. Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key 
patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. 
4. Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings 
and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates 
insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders. 
5. GitHub Repository: Include all Python scripts, SQL queries, and dashboard files in a 
well-structured repository.
